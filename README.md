 ## Downloading

  Just download and unzip or clone the project inside the folder you want
  * [Download] or clone:

  * Optional: Install or update all Grunt dependencies running:
  `npm install`

   `grunt`  - Use it when developing, takes less time to run and don't compress your files. Good for debug. It also open your defalt browser start a local server with livereload :)
